J2EE Policy Agent Sample Application
------------------------------------

This document describes how to use the agent sample application in conjunction 
with the Jetty Server and the J2EE Agent. Please note that 
the agent needs to be installed first before deploying this sample application.

    * Overview
    * Configure the OpenAM server
    * Configure the agent properties
    * Deploying the Sample Application
    * Running the Sample Application
    * Troubleshooting

Overview
--------

The sample application is a collection of servlets and JSPs that demonstrate the salient 
features of the J2EE policy Agent. These features include SSO, web-tier declarative security, 
URL policy evaluation and session/policy/profile attribute fetch.

The sample application agentsample.war is located in the <agent_install_root>/sampleapp/dist 
directory.

The sample application is supported for Policy Agent 3.0.

Configure the OpenAM server
----------------------------------------------
This agent sample application requires that the OpenAM server is configured
with the subjects and policies required by the sample application.

On OpenAM admin console, do the following configuration.
1.  Create the following users:
    Here is the following list of users with username/password :

    * andy/andy
    * bob/bob
    * chris/chris
    * dave/dave
    * ellen/ellen
    * frank/frank
    * gina/gina

2. Assign Users to Groups
   Create new groups for employee, manager, everyone and customer. Then assign 
   the users to the groups as follows:

    * employee:
          o andy, bob, chris, dave, ellen, frank
    * manager:
          o andy, bob, chris
    * everyone:
          o andy, bob, chris, dave, ellen, frank, gina
    * customer:
          o chris, ellen
    
3. Create the following URL Policies:
   In the following URLs, replace the <hostname> and <port> with the 
   actual fully qualified host name and port on which the sample 
   application will be running.

    * Policy 1:
          o allow:
                + http://<hostname>:<port>/agentsample/jsp/*
                + http://<hostname>:<port>/agentsample/protectedservlet
                + http://<hostname>:<port>/agentsample/securityawareservlet
          o Subject: all authenticated users.                     
    * Policy 2:
          o allow:
                + http://<hostname>:<port>/agentsample/urlpolicyservlet
          o Subject: Group: customer

Configure the agent properties
--------------------------------------------

   If the agent configuration is centralized, then do the following steps.
   1). Login to OpenAM console as amadmin user
   2). Navigate to Access Control/realm/Agents/J2EE, and click on the agent 
       instance link (assume the agent instance is already created, otherwise 
       refer to the agent doc to create the agent instance).
   3). In tab "Application", section "Access Denied URI Processing", property 
       "Resource Access Denied URI", enter agentsample in the Map Key field, 
       /agentsample/authentication/accessdenied.html in the Map Value field, and
       SAVE the change.
   4). In tab "Application", section "Login Processing", property "Login Form URI",
       add /agentsample/authentication/login.html, and SAVE the change.
   5). In tab "Application", section "Not Enforced URI Processing", property 
       "Not Enforced URIs", add the following entries:
          /agentsample/public/*
          /agentsample/images/*
          /agentsample/styles/*
          /agentsample/index.html
          /agentsample
       and SAVE the change. 
   
   If the agent configuration is local, then edit the local agent configuration
   file OpenSSOAgentConfiguration.properties located at the directory 
   <agent_install_root>/Agent_<instance_number>/config with following changes: 

    * Not enforced List:
      com.sun.identity.agents.config.notenforced.uri[0] = /agentsample/public/*
      com.sun.identity.agents.config.notenforced.uri[1] = /agentsample/images/*
      com.sun.identity.agents.config.notenforced.uri[2] = /agentsample/styles/*
      com.sun.identity.agents.config.notenforced.uri[3] = /agentsample/index.html
      com.sun.identity.agents.config.notenforced.uri[4] = /agentsample

    * Access Denied URI:
      com.sun.identity.agents.config.access.denied.uri[agentsample] = /agentsample/authentication/accessdenied.html
    * Form List:
      com.sun.identity.agents.config.login.form[0] = /agentsample/authentication/login.html

   Optionally, you can try out the fetch mode features that allow the agent to
   fetch some values and make them available to your application. For example, 
   you can fetch user profile values(like email or full name) from the user data
   store of your OpenAM setup and make them available to your application code
   (through cookies, headers, or request attributes) for application 
   customization. See the Policy Agent 3.0 for details about the fetching 
   attributes for details on using this feature. If you change the agent's 
   configuration for the attribute fetching, the showHttpHeaders.jsp page of the
   sample application will show all the attributes being fetched. You can choose
   to try this later after you have already installed and deployed the agent and
   sample application in order to learn about this feature.

Running the Sample Application
----------------------------
You can run the application through the following URL:

http://<hostname>:<port>/agentsample

Traverse the various links to understand each agent feature.


Troubleshooting
----------------------------
If you encounter problems when running the application, review the log files to learn what exactly 
went wrong. J2EE Agent logs can be found at <agent_install_root>/<agent_instance>/logs/debug directory.
